# pymaceuticals-challenge

For this challenge I referenced the book Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney. 
I also did use AI to help me create the last code for Correlation and Regression, as I could not figure it out on my own. 
I did attempt to use AI for the "# Put treatments into a list for for loop (and later for plot labels)" section, but even with AI I still could not figure it out.
